This repository provides instructions and teaching material (slides and project packages) for both Data Detectives, and both Data Influencers workshops presented in the paper "Engaging Young Minds: Learnings from Data Visualization Workshops with Children and Teenagers". 

This serves two purposes: 
1. Through the detailed materials on the workshops, the paper, its learnings and arguments become easier to understand and follow.
2. Educators who wish to conduct similar workshops can use the material as a basis for their own workshops. 

In particular Data Detectives 2 and Data Influencers 2 can be used directly, as they were already designed with the learnings from the previous workshops in mind. Only minor things could / should be adapted, for example 
- including opportunities for critical discussion of visualizations in the Data Detectives 2 workshop
- moving the critical thinking section in the Data Influencers 2 workshop to a later point in time

More details can be found in the paper.
